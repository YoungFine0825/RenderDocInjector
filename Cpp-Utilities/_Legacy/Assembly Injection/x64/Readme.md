# Readme for x64 Assembly Injection Functions  
Created by Sean P  
  
# Description:  
This project is a compilation of a few useful and portable (Linux or Windows) functions/utilities that can be used by a program to inject x64 Assembly code into its own address space. For more information about specific functions, see the function descriptions in the code comments. NOTE: This code is specifically for use in 64-bit programs, and is not compatible with 32-bit projects.  
  
  
# Object file compilation on Linux:  
To compile object files (.o) of this code for use with other projects, use the Makefile command 'all'.
